Salt Genesis Documentation
==========================

Salt Genesis is a toolkit designed to manage system images, both virtualized
and on bare metal. It is designed to co-exist with your existing tools, and
extend them to help make your life easier.

or implied. Feel free to muck around with the tools here, and make suggestions,
commits, whatever you feel will help.
